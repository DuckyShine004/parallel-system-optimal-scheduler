# Git Conventions

## Commit Messages

We decided to follow some conventions for our commit messages to better communicate the content of said commit. These message starters are what we have used in this repository:

- `Wiki` - commits related to the wiki eg. files within the `/wiki` folder.
- `Feat` - adding a new feature.
- `Bug` or `Fix` - fixing a bug.
- `Refactor` - reformatting or refactoring the code.
- `Test` - commits that are related to testing functionality and test cases.
- `Docs` - documentation of code.

**Usage:** These would be placed at the start of the commit header/message in conjunction with a commit message.

## Branching

Branches are to be used, which will be merged with `main` after the purpose of the branch has been completed. Pull requests will be reviewed by another member of the team before merging.
